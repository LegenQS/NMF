# Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
This file achieves factorization an N × M matrix X into a rank-K approximation W × H, where W is N × K and H is K × M. Notice here all the values in the matrices should be nonnegtive. Here initialize W and H with uniform distribution on (1,2), types of initialization could vary in class Matrix_Factor.
